## Basic diplomatic edition ("gold level")

1. editions have an explicitly defined structure. Usually, this will be some form of XML, but "TEI-compliant" won't make it, since that could be anything under the sun.  A distinct subset of TEI could work.
2. the structure supports an explicitly defined canonical citation system.
3. some form of validation is defined.  "We typed a lot and it didn't look bad when we reread it" won't make it.


## Full facsimile-level edition ("platinum level")##


4. preference given to editions that are backed by explicitly cited visual evidence
