ODE reviews diplomatic editions of any primary document (such as manuscripts, incriptions, papyri) for which we can find competent reviewers.  The current editorial board's expertise is primarily in Greek and Latin documents of all kinds, but we encourage potential editors of texts in other languages to consult with us about the possibility of finding reviewers for your work.
