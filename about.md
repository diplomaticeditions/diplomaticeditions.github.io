title: About Open Diplomatic Editions (ODE)

---


ODE reviews diplomatic editions of any primary document (such as manuscripts, incriptions, papyri) for which we can find competent reviewers.  The current editorial board's expertise is primarily in Greek and Latin documents of all kinds, but we encourage editors of texts in other languages to consult with us about the possibility of finding reviewers for your work.

ODE reviews editions to one of two standards:

1. Text-only editions
2. Full facsimile editions


See further information about each standard in "[Guidelines for submissions](../guidelines)".


## Access to editions ##


ODE makes editions available in archival data formats.  These are hosted and can be downloaded from the publication series' central github repository.  The master branch always has the most recent peer-reviewed release.  

In addition, ODE hosts a simple reading-browsing application you can use to read any ODE text from a web browser.  This includes an illustrated facsimile reader for ODE full-facsimile editions.


## Other services ##

ODE works with editors of *full-facsimile* editions to host openly licensed images in a citable image service.

In the future, we plan to offer a configuration for a virtual machine you can use to host and serve your own selection of ODE editions.
