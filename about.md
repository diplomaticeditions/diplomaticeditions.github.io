title: About Open Diplomatic Editions (ODE)

---


ODE reviews and publishes diplomatic editions of any primary document (such as manuscripts, incriptions, papyri) for which we can find competent reviewers.  The [current editorial board's](../edboard) expertise is primarily in Greek and Latin documents of all kinds, but we encourage editors of texts in other languages to consult with us about the possibility of finding reviewers for your work.

ODE reviews editions to one of two standards:

1. Text-only editions
2. Full facsimile editions


(See further information about each standard in "[Guidelines for submissions](../guidelines)".)

When an edition is accepted for publication, it is added to the next release both of the master branch of [ODE's github repository](https://github.com/diplomaticeditions/editions), and to the Canonical Text Service instance used by ODE's reading-browsing application.

While ODE only publishes completed diplomatic editions of texts or sections of texts, editors may submit partially complete editions for preliminary review.  If these are accepted, they will be added to the `inprogress` branch of ODE's github repository, and to a separate Canonical Text Service instance serving unpublished work in progress. 


## Access to editions ##


ODE makes editions available in archival data formats.  These are hosted on the publication series' central github repository and can be downloaded directly from there.  The repository's master branch always has the most recent peer-reviewed release.  

In addition, ODE hosts a simple reading-browsing application you can use to read any ODE text from a web browser.  This includes an illustrated facsimile reader for ODE full-facsimile editions.


## Other services ##

ODE works with editors of *full-facsimile* editions to host openly licensed images in a citable image service.

In the future, we plan to offer a configuration for a virtual machine you can use to host and serve your own selection of ODE editions.
