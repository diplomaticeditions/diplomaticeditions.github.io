title: Why open diplomatic editions?

The basis for studying how ancient texts have been used, recreated and transmitted to us is fundamentally changing as a consequence of the on-going proliferation of openly licensed images of manuscripts and other kinds of documents. For almost half a millennium, scholars working in print media have been compelled for practical reasons to reduce the published record of manuscript evidence to the terse annotations of a critical apparatus accompanying a critical edition, never able to present a full record of the content and the form of the written sources of our knowledge of the past. This restriction no longer has to apply: digital libraries can easily store complete diplomatic editions of texts that can be studied either in their own right, as specific moments in the history of a text, or as a basis for collating comprehensive evidence for modern critical editions. We therefore have an unprecedented need for diplomatic editions of the thousands of manuscripts that are now open to scholars anywhere on the internet.

Open Diplomatic Editions responds to that need by (1) defining criteria for evaluating digital diplomatic editions and publishing peer-reviewed editions; and (2) promoting best practices and establishing a review process that fosters a shared understanding of what it means to create a digital diplomatic edition.
